/*
	Lab 4 sample code. This code shows you the syntax for creating message queues and 
	receiving them, but it does not permit for an arbitrary number of threads of each type -
	that's your job to figure out. It also uses a fixed delay, rather than a random delay, and
	does not generate any statistics.
	
	Use this code as a starting point to learn how to use the RTX features. Feel free to modify
	it and use it as the start of your own main function.
